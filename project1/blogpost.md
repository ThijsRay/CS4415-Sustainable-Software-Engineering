Showing advertisements is one of the key ways to earn money on the internet. Whether it is through banner adsÂ¸ sponsored
messages or paid endorsements, advertising is everywhere. The online advertising industry is one of the fastest growing
industries. In the Netherlands
alone, [it grew by more than 100% in 8 year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/542808/net-online-advertising-market-revenue-in-the-netherlands-by-channel/)
. But what footprint does this industry leave behind? Large advertising companies
like [Google](https://sustainability.google/commitments/carbon/#) and [Meta](https://sustainability.fb.com/climate/)
have great ambitions of reaching net-zero emissions. However, their goals only apply to their own corporate emissions,
such as the energy usage of their datacenters or offices.

Given the fact that the services of advertising companies are consuming energy both the server *and* the client side,
the effect of advertising on the energy consumption of clients should not be forgotten. As more and more money is spent
on digital advertising, this becomes increasingly more important.

Users are becoming more ad aware, and there are many different tools for reducing the amount of advertising you see when
browsing. As you can see in the image below, adblock usage is becoming more popular. Already 763 million people use
adblockers worldwide. This shows annoyment towards online advertising, and makes it more difficult for websites to be
profitable. However, the sustainability impact of trying to block advertisements and trackers is most often not part of
people's consideration. Does this blocking increase your browser's energy consumption to find the ads? Or is it actually
saving your battery by reducing the amount of images that have to be downloaded?

![Adblocker usage](img/adblocking.png)

This will be the goal of our experiment. We will measure the effect that advertisements and adblockers have on the
additional energy usage of of our own devices. In [previous work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372799.3394372) there
have already been efforts to determine the power consumption of smart phones. However with the relatively more screen
real-estate to fill, advertisements can take up more space on the screens on full-size screens of desktops and laptop
computers.

Blocking advertisements on computers can be done by using an ad blocker. like the free and open-source ad
blocker [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/). We wrote automated tests
for [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to make experiment as replicable as possible. The tests were run with Selenium
with [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

The testsuite was executed on the same set of sites, with the only difference being whether uBlock Origin was installed.
Due to the previous research In combination with the use of selenium, we were able to automate the visit of different
websites, such that the experiments could be repeated 15 times. With
the [jouleit](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/jouleit) script from powerapi, the power consumptions during these website
visits was measured. Now we just need to find some interesting websites to measure the power consumption of. We came up
with the following list of websites, ranging from no advertisements at all to a lot of ads on a single page.

We judged the ad intensity ourselves to place the websites in 4 categories, as you can see in the table below. They link
to the exact page we used, so you can also have a look for yourself! We also list here, how many requests the adblocker
is blocking, which also takes into account requests that are less visible.

| Website | Ad intensity | # of requests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) | No ads | 0 (0%) |
| [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com) | No ads | 0 (0%) |
| [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium) | Low | 2 (7%) |
| [Reddit](https://reddit.com) | Low | 32 (3%) |
| [Sparknotes](https://www.sparknotes.com/cs/) | Medium | 7 (16%) |
| [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com) | Medium | 11 (7%) |
| [nu.nl](https://nu.nl) | High | 12 (7%) |
| [New York Times](https://nytimes.com) | High | 15 (10%) |

We decided to not preheat the system as normally is done in such tests, since the preheating is not done in regular use
of the webbrowser either. A user normally loads website one by one, therefore the CPU would not be pre-heated in a
regular scenario. In order to prevent as much deviation between tests as possible we opted to use a wired connection to
the internet and disable bluetooth as well. No other programs were running during execution. In the figure below, it can
be seen that this resulted in quite consistent results for the experiment. Only 2 out of 240 experiments did not finish
successfully, we removed these from the data. We also chose to remove the outliers where execution time was above 100
seconds for the further results. These runs most likely had some connectivity issues that would impact the energy
consumption. 

Total power consumption consists of two parts, the energy consumed during the visit and the time spent. Below you will
find a box plot of the time spent in watching the webpage. The time spent on every website is not equal since some
websites are longer compared to others. We decided to take the actual use case in consideration and to differ the amount
of time spent reading each website over an equal time. This should not skew the results, since we will compare the
ad-free websites relative to their ad-full variant.

![<<Smaller boxplot showing durations\>>](img/boxplot-complete-duration-with-duration-outliers.png)


In every test, we started the browser without any cache. Selenium was used to scroll from top to bottom each time, in
order to load all page content and ads. We repeated this for 15 iterations with and 15 iterations without adblocker for
every website. The execution order of the tests was randomly shuffled to reduce external effects. We only used Firefox
as a browser, but created the skeleton for easy future experiments with other browsers. We disabled all built-in
blocking features that Firefox offers, to only have the effects of the adblocker.

The results can be seen in the table below. It can be clearly seen that when scrolling on a page without any ads (Wikipedia
and Hackernews), using an adblocker consumes more energy. This energy consumption can be explained by the fact that the
adblocker still has to go through the page to see if there are any ads. The same can be see in a milder version for the
webpages with only a few ads. The extra energy consumption is here partly compensated by the reduced cost from not
having to load the images and animations in the ad. When visiting websites with higher ad intensity, this saved effort
is actually so much, that quite a lot of energy can be saved by turning on an adblocker.

| Website | Average power of cpu with adblocker (W) | Average power of cpu without adblocker (W)| Change of power of cpu from adblocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wikipedia | 3.54 | 3.256 | 0.2837 (8.7%) |
| Hackernews | 5.176 | 4.618 | 0.5579 (12.1%) |
| Stackoverflow | 4.295 | 4.384 | -0.08828 (-2.0%) |
| Reddit | 5.011 | 4.841 | 0.1707 (3.5%) |
| Sparknotes | 4.508 | 5.628 | -1.12 (-19.9%) |
| Dw | 4.117 | 4.442 | -0.3247 (-7.3%) |
| Nu | 3.523 | 6.091 | -2.568 (-42.2%) |
| Nytimes | 4.116 | 4.637 | -0.5212 (-11.2%) |
| Mean | 4.226 | 4.785 | -0.5591 (-11.7%) |

In the figure below, it can be seen that power consumption was not completely stable over iterations. The red boxplots
show the distribution of the results without adblocker, the blue boxplot with uBlock activated. The websites on the left
of the plot have less ads, more to the right means more ads. In general, it was expected that power is not very stable,
but the distributions seem to show that the effect of the adblocker is definitely visible.

Due to the small sample size of websites we are unable to say something about the entire surfing behaviour of users.
Especially because of the distributed nature of the internet. If one would like to determine the entire amount of energy
saved the shown ads also play a role. If a lot of animated ads are shown at the moment, it might be more effective to
use an ad blocker compared to a moment when only static ads are shown.

Discussion:
What went right 
where can the tests be improved  
What is the impact on society?
How can the current situtation be changed
--->

What can we conclude from this experiment? First of all, from the perspective of a web user, it can be seen that your
adblocker has significant impact on the amount of power you use while browsing. Especially if you are often on pages
with a lot of ads, it could be beneficial from both a sustainability and a battery life standpoint to use an adblocker.
On average over these websites, it already saves about half a Watt of power consumption. We only used the uBlock
adblocker, so more research can be done to compare different adblockers, but we believe this is probably also the case
when using a different program.

As an example, we made the calculation for one of the high ad intensive websites from our experiment. The Dutch
newspage 'nu.nl', which shows 2 banners, one static ad and an advertisement that scrolls along. This page reports having
around [800 million page loads per month](https://www.dpgmedia.nl/merken/nu) . Our experiment shows an average
energy saving of 228 J for every load, this means that 228 * 800 million * 12 = 2188.8 Gj could be saved every year if
everyone were to use an adblocker just for this one website. This is equivalent to driving a Tesla 3 for 3850
kilometers.

Our experiment also shows that there is still a lot to gain in the efficiency of the adblocker. If it would be able to
recognize when there are no ads, it would not cost as much extra when browsing on these pages. There may be many more
and less complicated ways to achieve more efficient ad recognizing. For example, we believe this could potentially be
achieved by whitelisting well-known ad-free websites. This can already be done manually and it could be a nice future
experiment to see, whether users can save energy by maintaining this themselves.

Another simple possibility would be to maybe keep more caches, to prevent having to redo this every page. However, it
should be noted that for this experiment, we restarted the browser every time. This might also have negatively impacted
the adblocker efficiency, as it might use more during start up.

For websites, it is of course difficult to earn their money without ads. It is however possible to take into
consideration how much energy this consumes. Maybe looking into smaller or less animated ads could save the user some
energy, and motivate the user not to activate a blocker. Or to provide the option for adblocking users to request
ad-free or ad-light pages directly instead. This would of course be more efficient than the current way of requesting
the full page and then blocking parts.

In general, 'more ads equals more energy consumption' seems a valid conclusion from our results. However, this is not
completely consistent. The Sparknotes ads seem to use a lot more extra energy in comparison to Deutsche Welle, while
they have a similar intensity. We did not look into enough webpages to be certain what makes ads more or less energy
consuming. However, our first intuition is that it has to do with the size of the webpage as well. A large web page,
with an advertisement that is only loaded once, but shows it continuously might be more efficient than loading ads on a
small page that is only visited for a short duration.

These are some of the many possible more detailed comparison that could be made to interpret these results even more.
What is the effect of ad size, the movement of ads, ad provider? But also, what is the effect of using a smaller or
larger screen or activating Firefox' trackers blocking?

In our opinion, the real, long-term solution would however be to make wider changes to the system. If it would be
possible to pay a small monthly fee, which is spread over all webpages you visit, we could save energy and frustration
from advertisements, while keeping the companies providing us with news and information with income. We understand this
would be a complicated and long process to change, but maybe this small experiment can provide a little extra
motivation!

Conclusion:
How many kilometers can we ride if we do a 1000 page loads?
